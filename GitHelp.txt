CLEAR HISTORY
-------------

If you need to remove files from the git history
(to get back space for exemple) you can do it with 
git-filter-repo:

* Clone https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo.git 
* Download Python Windows embeddable package (64-bit) from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
* Clone https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe.git somewhere (!that important to stay safe!)
* Launch a command prompt in the Cloned Alcinoe root directory
* set PATH=C:\Dev\git-filter-repo;%PATH%
* set PATH=c:\Program Files\Python;%PATH%
* git filter-repo --path-glob "Demos/*.exe" --invert-paths --force
* git filter-repo --path-glob "Demos/*.apk" --invert-paths --force
* git remote add origin https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe.git
* git push --force --all origin

You can also analyze the list of directories/files that 
can be deleted with this command:

git filter-repo --analyze

Git LFS
-------

Every account using Git Large File Storage receives 
1 GiB of free storage and 1 GiB a month of free bandwidth. 
If the bandwidth and storage quotas are not enough, you can 
choose to purchase an additional quota for Git LFS. 
Unused bandwidth doesn't roll over month-to-month.

To associate a file type in your repository with Git LFS
git lfs track "*.psd"

fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository

In my case the owner was built-in Administrators group and
my solution was just to change it to me
